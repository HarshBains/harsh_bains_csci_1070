    "# INDUCTIVE / DEDUCTIVE REASONING\n",
    "Inductive reasoning is the process of making generalized inferences using a noticed pattern in some specific, empirical data gathered from an observation of some sort (a dataset, experiment, etc.). This is in contrast to deductive reasoning, which begins with a theory and applies that theory to a specific case. Essentially, inductive reasoning is hunting for a probable theory, while deductive reasoning is hunting for probable results that prove a theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the former can be realizing that, each day, the clock tower in your neighborhood rings exactly at noon, without fail. Thus, you can conclude that the bell must always ring at noon. An example of the latter is thinking that mammals must have multiple organs, looking at a specific observation that dogs are mammals, and thus concluding that dogs must have multiple organs based on the premise that they are indeed mammals."
